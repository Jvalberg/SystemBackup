# System Backup

This repository contains a backup of important system files for my linux.
This repository is built up by different git submodules to separate the different backup areas,
such as dotfiles and the vim folder.

# Installation
Each subfolder and submodule contains its own installation.py script, which properly install
the files on the system. This will ensure that old files are backed up as well, if anything would go wrong.

# TODO
Revert scripts if something goes wrong, to restore the backed up files
